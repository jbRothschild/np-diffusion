# NP_EulerDiffusion
Solving differential equations numerically is possible using many open source programs, however this doesn't always let you to manipulate your domain and boundary conditions as efficiently as you'd require. For this project, we wanted to investigate the distribution of nanoparticles in complicated vasculature data. In the first part, we developped all the machinery of the diffusion of these simulations in the directory model. The first stage of the code is a simple euler method [main.py, diffusion.py, various_model.py]. Future development All data is stored in the directory data and figures are generated from figures.
