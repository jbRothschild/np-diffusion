Numerical simulations

\begin{equation}\label{diffusion}
		\frac{\partial n(\vec{x},t)}{\partial t} + {\nabla \cdot (\vec{v}n(\vec{x},t))} = \nabla^2n(\vec{x},t) + R
\end{equation}

Boundaries CLARITY: boundary conditions (periodic and neumann).

Concentrations of the nanoparticles in the vessel (at the hole surface) were fixed to follow the observed concentrations

\begin{equation}\label{conc_time}
		n_0(t) = 
\end{equation}

Diffusion coefficient.

\begin{equation}\label{conc_time}
		n_0(t) = 
\end{equation}

Simulations were run to obtain concentration profiles at 30 minutes post-injection.
