We used replicate laboratory populations of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for direct observation of critical slowing down before population collapse. We mapped the bifurcation diagram experimentally and found that the populations became more vulnerable to disturbance closer to the tipping point. Fluctuations of population density increased in size and duration near the tipping point, in agreement with the theory. Our results suggest that indicators of critical slowing down can provide advance warning of catastrophic thresholds and loss of resilience in a variety of dynamical systems.},

abstract = {Recently, a new group of multicellular microorganisms was discovered, called ‘cable bacteria' which are capable of generating and mediating electrical currents across centimetre-scale distances. By transporting electrons from cell to cell, cable bacteria can harvest electron donors and electron acceptors that are widely separated in space, thus providing them with a competitive advantage for survival in aquatic sediments. The underlying process of long-distance electron transport challenges some long-held ideas about the energy metabolism of multicellular organisms and entails a whole new type of electrical cooperation between cells. This review summarizes the current knowledge about these intriguing multicellular bacteria. Cable bacteria are a newly discovered group of multicellular bacteria that generate and mediate electrical currents along their long filamentous body. Long-distance electron transport by cable bacteria bridges centimeter distances and extends the known length scale of biological electron transport by orders of magnitude. Long-distance electron transport allows cable bacteria to harvest electron donors and electron acceptors in widely separated locations, thus challenging long-held ideas on redox zonation in subsurface environments. By generating electrical currents, cable bacteria induce measurable electrical fields and potentials within their environment, and turn aquatic sediments into a living battery. Their widespread occurrence and strong imprint on local biogeochemistry suggests that cable bacteria are important in the cycling of carbon, sulfur, and other elements.},

abstract = {Biofilms are found within the lungs of patients with chronic pulmonary infections, in particular patients with cystic fibrosis, and are the major cause of morbidity and mortality for these patients. The work presented here is part of a large interdisciplinary effort to develop an effective drug delivery system and treatment strategy to kill biofilms growing in the lung. The treatment strategy exploits silver-based antimicrobials, in particular, silver carbene complexes (SCC). This manuscript presents a mathematical model describing the growth of a biofilm and predicts the response of a biofilm to several basic treatment strategies. The continuum model is composed of a set of reaction-diffusion equations for the transport of soluble components (nutrient and antimicrobial), coupled to a set of reaction-advection equations for the particulate components (living, inert, and persister bacteria, extracellular polymeric substance, and void). We explore the efficacy of delivering SCC both in an aqueous solution and in biodegradable polymer nanoparticles. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) levels of antimicrobial in both free and nanoparticle-encapsulated forms are estimated. Antimicrobial treatment demonstrates a biphasic killing phenomenon, where the active bacterial population is killed quickly followed by a slower killing rate, which indicates the presence of a persister population. Finally, our results suggest that a biofilm with a ready supply of nutrient throughout its depth has fewer persister bacteria and hence may be easier to treat than one with less nutrient. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The features inferred by the RBM can be biologically interpreted in terms of structural modes, including residue-residue tertiary contacts and extended secondary motifs ({\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-helix and {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}-sheet), of functional modes controlling activity and ligand specificity, or of phylogenetic identity. In addition, we use RBM to design new protein sequences with putative properties by composing and turning up or down the different modes at will.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), linked with CRISPR associated (Cas) genes, can confer adaptive immunity to bacteria, against bacteriophage infections. Thus from a therapeutic standpoint, CRISPR immunity increases biofilm resistance to phage therapy. Recently, however, CRISPR-Cas genes have been implicated in reducing biofilm formation in lysogenized cells. Thus CRISPR immunity can have complex effects on phage–host–lysogen interactions, particularly in a biofilm. In this contribution, we develop and analyse a series of dynamical systems to elucidate and disentangle these interactions. Two competition models are used to study the effects of lysogens (first model) and CRISPR-immune bacteria (second model) in the biofilm. In the third model, the effect of delivering lysogens to a CRISPR-immune biofilm is investigated. Using standard analyses of equilibria, stability and bifurcations, our models predict that lysogens may be able to displace CRISPR-immune bacteria in a biofilm, and thus suggest strategies to eliminate phage-resistant biofilms.},

To better understand the relationship between the lung microbiome and early respiratory disease, we characterized the lower airways microbiome using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from clinically stable CF infants and preschoolers who underwent bronchoscopy and chest computed tomography (CT). Cross-sectional samples suggested a progression of the lower airways microbiome with age, beginning with relatively sterile airways in infancy. By age two, bacterial sequences typically associated with the oral cavity dominated lower airways samples in many CF subjects. The presence of an oral-like lower airways microbiome correlated with a significant increase in bacterial density and inflammation. These early changes occurred in many patients, despite the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in our cohort during the first two years of life. The majority of CF subjects older than four harbored a pathogen dominated airway microbiome, which was associated with a further increase in inflammation and the onset of structural lung disease, despite a negligible increase in bacterial density compared to younger patients with an oral-like airway microbiome. Our findings suggest that changes within the CF lower airways microbiome occur during the first years of life and that distinct microbial signatures are associated with the progression of early CF lung disease.},

Their mathematical descriptions must account for the mechanics of the polymer, the water, and the interaction between these two phases. This review focuses on multiphase flow models because this framework is natural for including the relative motion between the phases, the exchange of material between phases, and the additional stresses within the network that arise from nonspecific chemical interactions and the action of molecular motors. These models have been successful in accounting for how different forces are generated and transmitted to achieve cell motion and biofilm growth and they have demonstrated how emergent structures develop though the interactions of the two phases. A short description of multiphase flow models of tumor growth is included to highlight the flexibility of the model in describing diverse biological applications.},

abstract = {Oral biofilms, unlike those formed at most other sites in the human body, are unique because surgical intervention is usually unnecessary for their removal. The control of oral biofilms relies mainly on mechanical elimination. Chemical controls are used as alternative or adjunctive methods when elimination using dental instruments proves difficult. For many years, researches have focused on how microorganisms could be rapidly killed using high concentrations of antimicrobials or new antibacterial agents. New strategies that target the matrices of mature biofilms are needed because biofilm matrices inhibit the effect of antimicrobial agents through absorption and degradation. These strategies include the following possibilities: (1) use of antimicrobial agents with superior penetration properties and (2) degradation or detachment of matrix polymers. In order to investigate the penetration properties of antimicrobial agents, time-lapse microscopy can be used for noninvasive visualization of antimicrobial action inside models of oral biofilms. Factors that affect drug penetration properties include molecular weight, charge, hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance, and malabsorption/modification by the biofilm matrix. However, strategies that rely on antimicrobial agents have an important limitation. Even if the microorganisms are eradicated, their biofilm structure remains intact and may promote secondary biofilm and tartar formation. Therefore, future strategies should shift their focus to degradation and/or removal of matrix polymers. Some detachment-promoting agents have been reported. These agents have the potential to control biofilm accumulation effectively. Since the clinical efficacy remains unclear, and in addition to limitations of targeting a specific polysaccharide component and retention properties, further investigations are warranted. {\textcopyright} 2012 Japanese Association for Oral Biology.},

This suggests that P. aeruginosa might exist as biofilms--structured communities of bacteria encased in a self-produced polymeric matrix--in the cystic fibrosis lung. Consistent with this hypothesis, microscopy of cystic fibrosis sputum shows that P. aeruginosa are in biofilm-like structures. P. aeruginosa uses extracellular quorum-sensing signals (extracellular chemical signals that cue cell-density-dependent gene expression) to coordinate biofilm formation. Here we found that cystic fibrosis sputum produces the two principal P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing signals; however, the relative abundance of these signals was opposite to that of the standard P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 in laboratory broth culture. When P. aeruginosa sputum isolates were grown in broth, some showed quorum-sensing signal ratios like those of the laboratory strain. When we grew these isolates and PAO1 in a laboratory biofilm model, the signal ratios were like those in cystic fibrosis sputum. Our data support the hypothesis that P. aeruginosa are in a biofilm in cystic fibrosis sputum. Moreover, quorum-sensing signal profiling of specific P. aeruginosa strains may serve as a biomarker in screens to identify agents that interfere with biofilm development.},

First, collective cell protection results from inhibition of phage transport into the biofilm, which we demonstrate in vivo and in vitro. Second, CsgA fibres protect cells individually by coating their surface and binding phage particles, thereby preventing their attachment to the cell exterior.

abstract = {A theoretical framework was developed for analyzing the efficacy of antimicrobial agents when applied to microbial biofilms with which they react. Reaction-diffusion theory was adapted to investigate the potential for transport limitation of the overall rate of biofilm disinfection and the rate of antimicrobial penetration into the biofilm. Disinfection efficacy was investigated with simulations that assumed catalytic reaction of the antimicrobial agent with live and dead cells in a uniformly thick slab with simultaneous transformation of live to dead cells by an independent rate process (disinfection). The intrinsic rate of disinfection was assumed to follow first-order dependence on antimicrobial concentration. Zero- and first-order reaction kinetics of antimicrobial agent with biomass were analyzed. Microbial growth and external mass transfer resistance were neglected. Results show that antimicrobial efficacy, defined as the ratio of the observed rate of biofilm disinfection to the rate that would prevail in the absence of mass transport limitation, decreases sharply as the Thiele modulus exceeds one. The reduction in efficacy worsens when the antimicrobial dose is more concentrated or longer. A second case examined the penetration of an antimicrobial agent into a biofilm with which it reacts stoichiometrically, as would be expected with an oxidizing biocide such as chlorine or ozone. The antimicrobial agent eventually penetrates the biofilm by depleting the reactive biomass constituent, but the time scale for penetration can exceed the time scale for transient diffusion in the absence of reaction by orders of magnitute. These results provide a theoretical basis for explaining experimentally observed resistance of biofilms to chemical disinfectants. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

We also consider the components dissolved in liquid phase as CO2. The model is based on mixture theory and the behaviour of each component is described on the one hand by mass conservation, which takes into account biological features of the system, and on the other hand by conservation of momentum, which describes the physical properties of the components.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and highlight promising directions of future research on theoretical modeling of momentum transport in cellular biological media with focus on the formulation of governing equations and the calculation of material properties both theoretically and experimentally. With regard to the governing equations, significant work has been done with single-scale approaches (e.g. mixture theory), whereas traditional upscaling methods (e.g. homogenization, volume averaging) or multiscale equation-free approaches have received limited attention. The underlying concepts, strengths, and limitations of each approach, as well as examples of use in the field of biomaterials are presented. The current status of knowledge regarding the dependence of macroscopic material properties on the volume fractions, geometry, and intrinsic material properties of the constituent phases (cells, extracellular matrix and fluid) is also presented. The observation of conformational changes that occur at finer levels of the structural hierarchy during momentum transport, the correlation of macro-properties with geometrical and topological features of materials with heterogeneous and anisotropic microstructure, as well as the determination of dynamic material properties are among important challenges for future research. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Nanomaterials hold promise as multifunctional diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references).},

abstract = {Nanoparticles (NPs) represent one of the most promising tools for drug-targeting and drug-delivery. However, a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics that happen after their in vivo administration is required. Particularly, plasma proteins tend to associate to NPs, forming a new surface named the 'protein corona' (PC). This surface is the most exposed as the 'visible side' of NPs and therefore, can have a strong impact on NP biodistribution, targeting efficacy and also toxicity. The PC consists of two poorly delimited layers, known as 'hard corona' (HC) and 'soft corona' (SC), that are affected by the complexity of the environment and the formed protein-surface equilibrium during in vivo blood circulation. The HC corona is formed by proteins strongly associated to the NPs, while the SC is an outer layer consisting of loosely bound proteins. Several studies attempted to investigate the HC, which is easier to be isolated, but yielded poor reproducibility, due to varying experimental conditions. As a consequence, full mapping of the HC for different NPs is still lacking. Moreover, the current knowledge on the SC, which may play a major role in the 'first' interaction of NPs once in vivo, is very limited, mainly due to the difficulties in preserving it after purification. Therefore, multi-disciplinary approaches leading to the obtainment of a major number of information about the PC and its properties is strongly needed to fully understand its impact and to better support a more safety and conscious application of nanotechnology in medicine.},

A mechanistic understanding of the dynamic interaction between proteins and nanoparticles and thus the biological fate of nanoparticles and associated proteins is, however, often missing mainly due to the inadequacies in current ensemble experimental approaches. Through the application of a variety of single molecule and single particle spectroscopic techniques in combination with ensemble level characterization tools, we identified different interaction pathways between gold nanorods and bovine serum albumin depending on the protein concentration. Overall, we found that local changes in protein concentration influence everything from cancer cell uptake to nanoparticle stability and even protein secondary structure. We envision that our findings and methods will lead to strategies to control the associated pathophysiology of nanoparticle exposure in vivo.},

Biological fluids have complex compositions and the molecular components interact and function together in intricate networks. Therefore, the process to isolate blood or the preparation of blood derivatives may lead to differences in the composition of the identified protein corona around nanoparticles. Here, we show distinct differences in the protein corona formed in whole blood, whole blood with EDTA, plasma, or serum. Furthermore, the ratio between particle surface area to protein concentration influences the detected corona. We also show that the nanoparticle size per se influences the formed protein corona due to curvature effects. These results emphasize the need of investigating the formation and biological importance of the protein corona in the same environment as the nanoparticles are intended for or released into.},

abstract = {Due to their small size, nanoparticles have distinct properties compared with the bulk form of the same materials. These properties are rapidly revolutionizing many areas of medicine and technology. Despite the remarkable speed of development of nanoscience, relatively little is known about the interaction of nanoscale objects with living systems. In a biological fluid, proteins associate with nanoparticles, and the amount and presentation of the proteins on the surface of the particles leads to an in vivo response. Proteins compete for the nanoparticle "surface," leading to a protein "corona" that largely defines the biological identity of the particle. Thus, knowledge of rates, affinities, and stoichiometries of protein association with, and dissociation from, nanoparticles is important for understanding the nature of the particle surface seen by the functional machinery of cells. Here we develop approaches to study these parameters and apply them to plasma and simple model systems, albumin and fibrinogen. A series of copolymer nanoparticles are used with variation of size and composition (hydrophobicity). We show that isothermal titration calorimetry is suitable for studying the affinity and stoichiometry of protein binding to nanoparticles. We determine the rates of protein association and dissociation using surface plasmon resonance technology with nanoparticles that are thiol-linked to gold, and through size exclusion chromatography of protein-nanoparticle mixtures. This method is less perturbing than centrifugation, and is developed into a systematic methodology to isolate nanoparticle-associated proteins. The kinetic and equilibrium binding properties depend on protein identity as well as particle surface characteristics and size.},

We discuss cancer therapy, nanoparticle–biomolecule interactions, nanoparticle trafficking in cells, and triggers and responses to nanoparticle–cell interactions. No matter which functionalization strategy to target cancer is chosen, passive or active targeting, more than 99{\%} of the nanoparticles administered in vivo end up in the mononuclear phagocytic system, mainly sequestered by macrophages. Comprehensive studies, such as the one reported by MacParland et al. in this issue of ACS Nano, will help to close the gap between nanotechnology-based drug-delivery solutions and advanced medicinal products.},

We first consider osmosis through a membrane, and investigate the reflection coefficient of an imperfectly semi-permeable membrane, in the dilute and high concentration regimes. We then explore the diffusion-osmotic flow of a solute-solvent fluid adjacent to a solid surface, driven by a chemical potential gradient parallel to the surface. We propose a novel non-equilibrium MD (NEMD) methodology to simulate diffusion-osmosis, by imposing an external force on every particle, which properly mimics the chemical potential gradient on the solute in spite of the periodic boundary conditions. This NEMD method is validated theoretically on the basis of linear-response theory by matching the mobility with their Green-Kubo expressions. Finally, we apply the framework to more realistic systems, namely a water-ethanol mixture in contact with a silica or a graphene surface.},

We demonstrate in particular how the general expression of the osmotic pressure for mixtures, as obtained classically from the thermodynamic framework, emerges from the mechanical balance controlling non-equilibrium transport under solute gradients. Expressions for the rejection coefficient of osmosis and the diffusio-osmotic mobilities are accordingly obtained.

abstract = {Osmosis is a physical phenomenon that has been extensively studied by scientists in various disciplines of science and engineering. Early researchers studied the mechanism of osmosis through natural materials, and from the 1960s, special attention has been given to osmosis through synthetic materials. Following the progress in membrane science in the last few decades, especially for reverse osmosis applications, the interests in engineered applications of osmosis has been spurred. Osmosis, or as it is currently referred to as forward osmosis, has new applications in separation processes for wastewater treatment, food processing, and seawater/brackish water desalination. Other unique areas of forward osmosis research include pressure-retarded osmosis for generation of electricity from saline and fresh water and implantable osmotic pumps for controlled drug release. This paper provides the state-of-the-art of the physical principles and applications of forward osmosis as well as their strengths and limitations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The paper presents a theoretical model that allows the dynamic description of osmotic flows through a semi-permeable interface. To depict the out-of-equilibrium transfer, the interface is represented by an energy barrier that colloids have to overcome to be transmitted to the other side of the membrane. This energy barrier thus represents the selectivity of the membrane. Furthermore, this energy barrier induces additional force terms in the momentum and the mass balances on the fluid and the colloids phases. Based on a two- fluid model, these forces can reproduce the physics of the osmotic flow without the use of the semi-empirical laws of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It is shown that a decrease in local pressure near the interface initiates osmosis. When these balance equations are solved in a transient mode, the dynamic of the osmotic flow can be described. The paper illustrates these potentialities by showing the dynamic of an osmosis process occurring in the absence of transmembrane pressure and both the dynamic of the reverse osmosis with a constant flow through the membrane. A simulation reproducing the dynamic of the Abb$\backslash$'e Nollet experiment is presented. The role played by the colloid-membrane interactions on the osmotic flow mechanism and on the counter osmotic pressure is analyzed and discussed in great details.},

abstract = {Systems with interfaces are abundant in both technological applications and biology. While a fluid interface separates two fluids, membranes separate the inside of vesicles from the outside, the interior of biological cells from the environment, and compartmentalize cells into organelles. The physical properties of interfaces are characterized by interface tension, those of membranes are characterized by bending and stretching elasticity. Amphiphilic molecules like surfactants that are added to a system with two immiscible fluids decrease the interface tension and induce a bending rigidity. Lipid bilayer membranes of vesicles can be stretched or compressed by osmotic pressure; in biological cells, also the presence of a cytoskeleton can induce membrane tension. If the thickness of the interface or the membrane is small compared with its lateral extension, both can be described using two-dimensional mathematical surfaces embedded in three-dimensional space. We review recent work on the interaction of particles with interfaces and membranes. This can be micrometer-sized particles at interfaces that stabilise emulsions or form colloidosomes, as well as typically nanometer-sized particles at membranes, such as viruses, parasites, and engineered drug delivery systems. In both cases, we first discuss the interaction of single particles with interfaces and membranes, e.{\~{}}g.$\backslash$ particles in external fields, followed by interface-mediated interaction between two particles, many-particle interactions, interface and membrane curvature-induced phenomena, and applications.},

abstract = {The most consistent result in more than two decades of experimental evolution is that the fitness of populations adapting to a constant environment does not increase indefinitely, but reaches a plateau. Using experimental evolution with bacteriophage, we show here that the converse is also true. In populations small enough such that drift overwhelms selection and causes fitness to decrease, fitness declines down to a plateau. We demonstrate theoretically that both of these phenomena must be due either to changes in the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations, the size of mutational effects, or both. We use mutation accumulation experiments and molecular data from experimental evolution to show that the most significant change in mutational effects is a drastic increase in the rate of beneficial mutation as fitness decreases. In contrast, the size of mutational effects changes little even as organismal fitness changes over several orders of magnitude. These findings have significant implications for the dynamics of adaptation.},

In theoretical physics, there is a burst of research activity in analyzing large fluctuations in stochastic population dynamics.

This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the 'relative stabilities' of N attractors (N {\textgreater} 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin-Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.},

Therefore, the development of drug delivery systems able to target the tumor site is becoming a real challenge that is currently addressed. Nanomedicine can reach tumor passively through the leaky vasculature surrounding the tumors by the Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect whereas ligands grafted at the surface of nanocarriers allow active targeting by binding to the receptors overexpressed by cancer cells or angiogenic endothelial cells. This review is divided into two parts: the first one describes the tumor microenvironment and the second one focuses on the exploitation and the understanding of these characteristics to design new drug delivery systems targeting the tumor.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The accelerating loss and fragmentation of natural habitats (Morris, 1995), of which most of us are personally and painfully aware, makes it tempting to suggest that, in an increasing number of species, the spatial structure of populations is somehow consequential to their dynamics. Many studies have demonstrated that small populations in small habitat fragments have a high risk of extinction(Schoener and Spiller, 1987b; Kindvall and Ahlen, 1992; Hanski, 1994b); hence if only small fragments remain, long-term persstence becomes necessarily a regional issue. We have now an extensive theoretical literature on metapopulation dynamics(Hanski, 1985, 1994a,b; Gilpin and Hanski, 1991; Hastings, 1991; gyllenberg and Hanski, 1992; Hanski and Gyllenberg, 1993; Hastings and Higgins, 1994; Tilman et al., 1994; Hassell et al., 1994; Durrett and Levin, 1994; Hastings and Harrison, 1994) and a large number of useful empirical studies (Harrison et al., 1988; McCauley, 1989; Nachman, 1991; Harrison, 1991; Sjogren, 1991; Sjogren Gulve, 1994; Whitlock, 1992b; Thomas and Harrison, 1992; Bengtsson, 1993; Hanski et al., 1994, 1995a; many chapters in this volume). Nonetheless it is fair to say that our understanding of metapopulation dynamics in real fragmented landscapes is still restricted (Harrison and Taylor, this volume), largely because of the practical problems of conducting sound empirical research at a sufficiently large spatial scale.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews stochastic models of extinction within a local population. The main thread of the chapter is an analytic model of environmental stochasticity, in which populations fluctuate between a ceiling and extinction. A diffusion analysis of environmental and demographic stochasticity is complemented by analytic and numerical investigations into the robustness of the analysis. The environmental stochasticity model presented in this chapter generates simple analytic predictions of extinction rates and population densities. These can be used in metapopulation models to improve analysis of the fundamental processes of extinction and colonization. The environmental stochasticity model has many largely unexplored implications for metapopulation dynamics. Emigration rates are influenced by local fluctuations; extinction rates become correlated across populations; and the time scales of local growth and extinction may overlap. Simulations in discrete time, used in the study, show that the diffusion analysis works. The robustness investigations show that the model can be extended to deal with many biological details.},

abstract = {Extinction risk in natural populations depends on stochastic factors that affect individuals, and is estimated by incorporating such factors into stochastic models. Stochasticity can be divided into four categories, which include the probabilistic nature of birth and death at the level of individuals (demographic stochasticity), variation in population-level birth and death rates among times or locations (environmental stochasticity), the sex of individuals and variation in vital rates among individuals within a population (demographic heterogeneity). Mechanistic stochastic models that include all of these factors have not previously been developed to examine their combined effects on extinction risk. Here we derive a family of stochastic Ricker models using different combinations of all these stochastic factors, and show that extinction risk depends strongly on the combination of factors that contribute to stochasticity. Furthermore, we show that only with the full stochastic model can the relative importance of environmental and demographic variability, and therefore extinction risk, be correctly determined. Using the full model, we find that demographic sources of stochasticity are the prominent cause of variability in a laboratory population of Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle), whereas using only the standard simpler models would lead to the erroneous conclusion that environmental variability dominates. Our results demonstrate that current estimates of extinction risk for natural populations could be greatly underestimated because variability has been mistakenly attributed to the environment rather than the demographic factors described here that entail much higher extinction risk for the same variability level.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure PD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general PD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding PD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

While the deterministic approach (rate equations) predicts the coexistence of the species resulting in regular (yet neutrally stable) oscillations of the population densities, we demonstrate that fluctuations arising in the system with a $\backslash$emph{\{}finite number of agents{\}} drastically alter this picture and are responsible for extinction: After long enough time, two of the three species die out.

abstract = {Populations of competing biological species exhibit a fascinating interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of evolutionary selection forces and random fluctuations arising from the stochastic nature of the interactions. The processes leading to extinction of species, whose understanding is a key component in the study of evolution and biodiversity, are influenced by both of these factors. In this paper, we investigate a class of stochastic population dynamics models based on generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. In the case of neutral stability of the underlying deterministic model, the impact of intrinsic noise on the survival of species is dramatic: it destroys coexistence of interacting species on a time scale proportional to the population size. We introduce a new method based on stochastic averaging which allows one to understand this extinction process quantitatively by reduction to a lower-dimensional effective dynamics. This is performed analytically for two highly symmetrical models and can be generalized numerically to more complex situations. The extinction probability distributions and other quantities of interest we obtain show excellent agreement with simulations.},

Medical interventions, lifestyle changes, and the normal rhythms of life sometimes upset the balance in microbial ecosystems, facilitating pathogen invasions or causing other clinically relevant problems. Some diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis, have exactly this sort of community etiology. Mathematical network theory is ideal for studying the ecological networks of interacting species that comprise the human microbiome. Theoretical networks require little consortia specific data to provide insight into both normal and disturbed microbial community functions, but it is easy to incorporate additional empirical data as it becomes available. We argue that understanding some diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis, requires a shift of focus from individual bacteria to (mathematical) networks of interacting populations, and that known emergent properties of these networks will provide insights that would be otherwise elusive.},

Maintenance of environmental conditions (healthy to a host) can differ between various community compositions.

Predation is included via a general nonlinear expression for the functional response of predation to prey density. We investigate the effects of the foraging parameters (e.g. attack rate and handling time) on the mean time to extinction. Mean time to extinction varies by orders of magnitude when we alter the foraging parameters, even when we exclude the effects of these parameters on the equilibrium population size. Conclusions are robust to assumptions about initial conditions and variable predator abundance.

We use a birth, death and mutation model to study clonal competition in a GC over time. We find that, like all evolutionary processes, diversity loss is inherently stochastic. We study two selection mechanisms, birth-limited and death limited selection. While death limited selection maintains diversity and allows for slow clonal homogenization as affinity increases, birth limited selection results in more rapid takeover of successful clones. Finally, we qualitatively compare our model to experimental observations of clonal selection in mice.},

abstract = {We investigate the phenomenon of extinction of a long-lived self-regulating stochastic population, caused by intrinsic (demographic) noise. Extinction typically occurs via one of two scenarios depending on whether the absorbing state n=0 is a repelling (scenario A) or attracting (scenario B) point of the deterministic rate equation. In scenario A the metastable stochastic population resides in the vicinity of an attracting fixed point next to the repelling point n=0 . In scenario B there is an intermediate repelling point n=n1 between the attracting point n=0 and another attracting point n=n2 in the vicinity of which the metastable population resides. The crux of the theory is a dissipative variant of WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation which assumes that the typical population size in the metastable state is large. Starting from the master equation, we calculate the quasistationary probability distribution of the population sizes and the (exponentially long) mean time to extinction for each of the two scenarios. When necessary, the WKB approximation is complemented (i) by a recursive solution of the quasistationary master equation at small n and (ii) by the van Kampen system-size expansion, valid near the fixed points of the deterministic rate equation. The theory yields both entropic barriers to extinction and pre-exponential factors, and holds for a general set of multistep processes when detailed balance is broken. The results simplify considerably for single-step processes and near the characteristic bifurcations of scenarios A and B.},

In addition, several new results are introduced to clearly illustrate similarities between the models. Specifically, the relations between the mean persistence time and higher-order moments for discrete-time Markov chain models, continuous-time Markov chain models, and stochastic differential equation models are compared for populations experiencing demographic variability. Similarities between the models are demonstrated analytically, and computational results are provided to show that estimated persistence times for the three stochastic models are generally in good agreement when the models are consistently formulated. As an example, the three stochastic models are applied to a population satisfying logistic growth. Logistic growth is interesting as different birth and death rates can yield the same logistic differential equation. However, the persistence behavior of the population is strongly dependent on the explicit forms for the birth and death rates. Computational results demonstrate how dramatically the mean persistence time can vary for different populations that experience the same logistic growth. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The WKB approximation allows one to evaluate the mean time and/or probability of population extinction, fixation and switches resulting from either intrinsic (demographic) noise, or a combination of the demographic noise and environmental variations, deterministic or random. We mostly cover well-mixed populations, single and multiple, but also briefly consider populations on heterogeneous networks and spatial populations. The spatial setting also allows one to study large fluctuations of the speed of biological invasions. Finally, we briefly discuss possible directions of future work.},

abstract = {Momentum-space representation provides an interesting perspective on the theory of large fluctuations in populations undergoing Markovian stochastic gain–loss processes. This representation is obtained when the master equation for the probability distribution of the population size is transformed into an evolution equation for the probability generating function. Spectral decomposition then yields an eigenvalue problem for a non-Hermitian linear differential operator. The ground-state eigenmode encodes the stationary distribution of the population size. For long-lived metastable populations which exhibit extinction or escape to another metastable state, the quasi-stationary distribution and the mean time to extinction or escape are encoded by the eigenmode and eigenvalue of the lowest excited state. If the average population size in the stationary or quasi-stationary state is large, the corresponding eigenvalue problem can be solved via the WKB approximation amended by other asymptotic methods. We illustrate these ideas in several model examples.},

abstract = {The extinction of a single species due to demographic stochasticity is analyzed. The discrete nature of the individual agents and the Poissonian noise related to the birth-death processes result in local extinction of a metastable population, as the system hits the absorbing state. The Fokker-Planck formulation of that problem fails to capture the statistics of large deviations from the metastable state, while approximations appropriate close to the absorbing state become, in general, invalid as the population becomes large. To connect these two regimes, a master equation based on a real space WKB method is presented, and is shown to yield an excellent approximation for the decay rate and the extreme events statistics all the way down to the absorbing state. The details of the underlying microscopic process, smeared out in a mean field treatment, are shown to be crucial for an exact determination of the extinction exponent. This general scheme is shown to reproduce the known results in the field, to yield new corollaries and to fit quite precisely the numerical solutions. Moreover it allows for systematic improvement via a series expansion where the small parameter is the inverse of the number of individuals in the metastable state.},

abstract = {This review provides a pedagogic and self-contained introduction to master equations and to their representation by path integrals. We discuss analytical and numerical methods for the solution of master equations, keeping our focus on methods that are applicable even when stochastic fluctuations are strong. The reviewed methods include the generating function technique and the Poisson representation, as well as novel ways of mapping the forward and backward master equations onto linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Spectral methods, WKB approximations, and a variational approach have been proposed for the analysis of the PDE obeyed by the generating function. After outlining these methods, we solve the derived PDEs in terms of two path integrals. The path integrals provide distinct exact representations of the conditional probability distribution solving the master equations. We exemplify both path integrals in analysing elementary chemical reactions. Furthermore, we review a method for the approximation of rare event probabilities and derive path integral representations of Fokker-Planck equations. To make our review accessible to a broad community, we have used the language of probability theory rather than quantum (field) theory. The probabilistic structures underpinning various technical concepts, such as coherent states, the Doi-shift, and normal-ordered observables, are thereby made explicit.},

@article{Iyer-Biswas2015,
abstract = {Often sharp changes in cellular behavior are triggered by thresholded events, i.e., by the attainment of a threshold value of a relevant cellular or molecular dynamical variable. Since the governing variable itself typically undergoes noisy or stochastic dynamics, there is a corresponding variability in the times when the same change occurs in each cell of a population. This time is called the "first passage" time and the corresponding process is a "first passage" (FP) process, referring to the event when a random variable first passes the threshold value. In this review we first present and elucidate fundamentals of the FP formalism within a unified conceptual framework, which naturally integrates the existing techniques. We then discuss applications thereof, with emphasis on the practical use of FP techniques in biophysical systems. Our focus here is on covering a diverse set of analytical techniques; the number of reviewed biological applications is thus limited, out of necessity. We focus on three specific areas: channel transport; receptor binding and adhesion; and single-cell growth and division.},

@article{VonBronk2017,
abstract = {In phenotypically heterogeneous microbial populations, the decision to adopt one or another phenotype is often stochastically regulated. However, how this stochasticity affects interac- tions between competing microbes in mixed communities is difficult to assess. One example of such an interaction system is the competition of an Escherichia coli strain C, which per- forms division of labor between reproducers and self-sacrificing toxin producers, with a toxin-sensitive strain S. The decision between reproduction or toxin production within a single Ccell is inherently stochastic. Here, combining experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that this stochasticity in the initial phase of colony formation is the crucial determinant for the competition outcome. In the initial phase (t {\textless} 12h), stochasti- city influences the formation of viable Cclusters at the colony edge. In the subsequent phase, the effective fitness differences (set primarily by the degree of division of labor in the C strain population) dictate the deterministic population dynamics and consequently compe- tition outcome. In particular, we observe that competitive success of the Cstrain is only found if (i) aC edge cluster has formed at the end of the initial competition phase and (ii) the beneficial and detrimental effects of toxin production are balanced, which is the case at inter- mediate toxin producer fractions. Our findings highlight the importance of stochastic pro- cesses during the initial phase of colony formation, which might be highly relevant for other microbial community interactions in which the random choice between phenotypes can have long-lasting consequences for community fate.},

abstract = {A diverse array of tumor targeting agents ranging in size from peptides to nanoparticles is currently under development for applications in cancer imaging and therapy. However, it remains largely unclear how size differences among these molecules influence their targeting properties. Here, we develop a simple, mechanistic model that can be used to understand and predict the complex interplay between molecular size, affinity, and tumor uptake. Empirical relationships between molecular radius and capillary permeability, interstitial diffusivity, available volume fraction, and plasma clearance were obtained using data in the literature. These relationships were incorporated into a compartmental model of tumor targeting using MATLAB to predict the magnitude, specificity, time dependence, and affinity dependence of tumor uptake for molecules across a broad size spectrum. In the typical size range for proteins, the model uncovers a complex trend in which intermediate-sized targeting agents (MW, approximately 25 kDa) have the lowest tumor uptake, whereas higher tumor uptake levels are achieved by smaller and larger agents. Small peptides accumulate rapidly in the tumor but require high affinity to be retained, whereas larger proteins can achieve similar retention with {\textgreater}100-fold weaker binding. For molecules in the size range of liposomes, the model predicts that antigen targeting will not significantly increase tumor uptake relative to untargeted molecules. All model predictions are shown to be consistent with experimental observations from published targeting studies. The results and techniques have implications for drug development, imaging, and therapeutic dosing.},

The third-generation sequencing (TGS) technology, led by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), is progressing rapidly, moving from a technology once only capable of providing data for small genome analysis, or for performing targeted screening, to one that promises high quality de novo assembly and structural variation detection for human-sized genomes. In 2014, the MinION, the first commercial sequencer using nanopore technology, was released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). MinION identifies DNA bases by measuring the changes in electrical conductivity generated as DNA strands pass through a biological pore. Its portability, affordability, and speed in data production makes it suitable for real-time applications, the release of the long read sequencer MinION has thus generated much excitement and interest in the genomics community. While de novo genome assemblies can be cheaply produced from SGS data, assembly continuity is often relatively poor, due to the limited ability of short reads to handle long repeats. Assembly quality can be greatly improved by using TGS long reads, since repetitive regions can be easily expanded into using longer sequencing lengths, despite having higher error rates at the base level. The potential of nanopore sequencing has been demonstrated by various studies in genome surveillance at locations where rapid and reliable sequencing is needed, but where resources are limited.},

abstract = {The chronic colonization of the lower airways by bacterial pathogens is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common CF pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus. Improvements in airway clearance and more effective treatment of the conventional CF pathogens has led to the emergence of new airway pathogens such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Mycobacterium abscessus, and Achromobacter. More recently, it has become appreciated that the lower airways in patients with CF are colonized by a more complex polymicrobial community composed primarily of bacteria found in the upper respiratory tract. This includes obligate anaerobes, most commonly Prevotella. Expanded culturing methods and culture-independent molecular methods are being used to characterize the composition and dynamics of these polymicrobial communities in patients with CF.

We consider how this new perspective in cystic fibrosis (CF) may affect treatment choices.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Standard clinical microbiology of CF infection exacerbations often fails to provide indications of microbial causes that may drive the onset of exacerbation and the anticipated bacteriologic responses to the usual parenteral antibiotics prescribed as treatment. Antimicrobial responses by nonclassical members of the CF airway microbiome may explain why most patients clinically improve. These other organisms contribute to disease either directly as pathogens missed by conventional microbiology or through synergy with conventional pathogens. With these considerations, therapy may best be guided by directed antibiotic therapy to numerically significant isolates. An example is the Streptococcus milleri group, which we now believe to represent new pathogens that profile the exacerbations of infection in the CF lung and that necessitate specific antibiotic therapy to prevent loss of lung function and reduce frequency of exacerbations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: A comprehensive understanding of airway infections offers the potential for improved disease management in CF patients. Accurate quantitative microbiology will be a prerequisite for routine intervention based on the polymicrobial perspective of CF infection exacerbations.},

abstract = {Understanding the nature of interpopulation interactions in host-associated microbial communities is critical to understanding gut colonization, responses to perturbations, and transitions between health and disease. Characterizing these interactions is complicated by the complexity of these communities and the observation that even if populations can be cultured, their in vitro and in vivo phenotypes differ significantly. Dynamic models are the cornerstone of computational systems biology and a key objective of computational systems biologists is the reconstruction of biological networks (i.e., network inference) from high-throughput data. When such computational models reflect biology, they provide an opportunity to generate testable hypotheses as well as to perform experiments that are impractical or not feasible in vivo or in vitro. We modeled time-series data for murine microbial communities using statistical approaches and systems of ordinary differential equations. To obtain the dense time-series data, we sequenced the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene from DNA isolated from the fecal material of germfree mice colonized with cecal contents of conventionally raised animals. The modeling results suggested a lack of mutualistic interactions within the community. Among the members of the Bacteroidetes, there was evidence for closely related pairs of populations to exhibit parasitic interactions. Among the Firmicutes, the interactions were all competitive. These results suggest future animal and in silico experiments. Our modeling approach can be applied to other systems to provide a greater understanding of the dynamics of communities associated with health and disease.},

@article{Conrad2013,
abstract = {In the context of a polymicrobial infection, treating a specific pathogen poses challenges because of unknown consequences on other members of the community. The presence of ecological interactions between microbes can change their physiology and response to treatment. For example, in the cystic fibrosis lung polymicrobial infection, antimicrobial susceptibility testing on clinical isolates is often not predictive of antibiotic efficacy. Novel approaches are needed to identify the interrelationships within the microbial community to better predict treatment outcomes. Here we used an ecological networking approach on the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics. This analysis showed that the community is separated into three interaction groups: Gram-positive anaerobes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The P. aeruginosa and S. aureus groups both anti-correlate with the anaerobic group, indicating a functional antagonism. When patients are clinically stable, these major groupings were also stable, however, during exacerbation, these communities fragment. Co-occurrence networking of functional modules annotated from metagenomics data supports that the underlying taxonomic structure is driven by differences in the core metabolism of the groups. Topological analysis of the functional network identified the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis as a keystone for the microbial community, which can be targeted with the antibiotic fosmidomycin. This study uses ecological theory to identify novel treatment approaches against a polymicrobial disease with more predictable outcomes. Studying the varying ecology of complex microbial infections in the lungs may help guide treatment options in cystic fibrosis. The disease is complicated due to infection with a diverse community of pathogenic microorganisms. The success of treatments based on identifying and targeting specific microbes can be unpredictable due to the effects of interactions within the mixed microbial ecosystem. Stefanie Widder at the University of Vienna together with Robert Quinn and co-workers in the USA, studied these interactions in six specific cases of cystic fibrosis using lung infection samples gathered over 10 years. They identified three main groups of bacteria involved and developed several hypotheses about inter-relationships that can affect the success of antibiotic treatments. The researchers argue that their new hypotheses and overall ‘ecological theory' will lead to more-reliable predictions of the likely benefits of specific treatment regimes.},

The importance of within-species genetic and phenotypic variation has similarly received limited explicit attention.

Cystic fibrosis respiratory tracts can be described as natural environments harbouring persisting microbial communities with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a dominant pathogen. Various factors contribute to the complexity of this ecosystem, including community composition, dynamics and interactions, as well as heterogeneous distribution and fluctuation of components of the immune system, antibiotics and nutrients. All these elements constitute the selective forces that drive the evolution of the microbes after they migrate from the outer environment to human airways.

abstract = {The structure and dynamics of bacterial communities in the airways of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) remain largely unknown. We characterized the bacterial communities in 126 sputum samples representing serial collections spanning 8-9 y from six age-matched male CF patients. Sputum DNA was analyzed by bar-coded pyrosequencing of the V3-V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, defining 662 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from {\textgreater}633,000 sequences. Bacterial community diversity decreased significantly over time in patients with typically progressive lung disease but remained relatively stable in patients with a mild lung disease phenotype. Antibiotic use, rather than patient age or lung function, was the primary driver of decreasing diversity. Interpatient variability in community structure exceeded intrapatient variability in serial samples. Antibiotic treatment was associated with pronounced shifts in community structure, but communities showed both short- and long-term resilience after antibiotic perturbation. There was a positive correlation between OTU occurrence and relative abundance, with a small number of persistent OTUs accounting for the greatest abundance. Significant changes in community structure, diversity, or total bacterial density at the time of pulmonary exacerbation were not observed. Despite decreasing community diversity in patients with progressive disease, total bacterial density remained relatively stable over time. These findings show the critical relationship between airway bacterial community structure, disease stage, and clinical state at the time of sample collection. These features are the key parameters with which to assess the complex ecology of the CF airway.},

Changes in microbial community structure are associated with some, but not all, pulmonary exacerbations, supporting previous observations suggesting that distinct types of exacerbations occur in CF.

abstract = {While originally characterized as a collection of related syndromes, cystic fibrosis (CF) is now recognized as a single disease whose diverse symptoms stem from the wide tissue distribution of the gene product that is defective in CF, the ion channel and regulator, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Defective CFTR protein impacts the function of the pancreas and alters the consistency of mucosal secretions. The latter of these effects probably plays an important role in the defective resistance of CF patients to many pathogens. As the modalities of CF research have changed over the decades from empirical histological studies to include biophysical measurements of CFTR function, the clinical management of this disease has similarly evolved to effectively address the ever-changing spectrum of CF-related infectious diseases. These factors have led to the successful management of many CF-related infections with the notable exception of chronic lung infection with the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The virulence of P. aeruginosa stems from multiple bacterial attributes, including antibiotic resistance, the ability to utilize quorum-sensing signals to form biofilms, the destructive potential of a multitude of its microbial toxins, and the ability to acquire a mucoid phenotype, which renders this microbe resistant to both the innate and acquired immunologic defenses of the host.},

abstract = {In the context of a polymicrobial infection, treating a specific pathogen poses challenges because of unknown consequences on other members of the community. The presence of ecological interactions between microbes can change their physiology and response to treatment. For example, in the cystic fibrosis lung polymicrobial infection, antimicrobial susceptibility testing on clinical isolates is often not predictive of antibiotic efficacy. Novel approaches are needed to identify the interrelationships within the microbial community to better predict treatment outcomes. Here we used an ecological networking approach on the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics. This analysis showed that the community is separated into three interaction groups: Gram-positive anaerobes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The P. aeruginosa and S. aureus groups both anti-correlate with the anaerobic group, indicating a functional antagonism. When patients are clinically stable, these major groupings were also stable, however, during exacerbation, these communities fragment. Co-occurrence networking of functional modules annotated from metagenomics data supports that the underlying taxonomic structure is driven by differences in the core metabolism of the groups. Topological analysis of the functional network identified the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis as a keystone for the microbial community, which can be targeted with the antibiotic fosmidomycin. This study uses ecological theory to identify novel treatment approaches against a polymicrobial disease with more predictable outcomes. Studying the varying ecology of complex microbial infections in the lungs may help guide treatment options in cystic fibrosis. The disease is complicated due to infection with a diverse community of pathogenic microorganisms. The success of treatments based on identifying and targeting specific microbes can be unpredictable due to the effects of interactions within the mixed microbial ecosystem. Stefanie Widder at the University of Vienna together with Robert Quinn and co-workers in the USA, studied these interactions in six specific cases of cystic fibrosis using lung infection samples gathered over 10 years. They identified three main groups of bacteria involved and developed several hypotheses about inter-relationships that can affect the success of antibiotic treatments. The researchers argue that their new hypotheses and overall ‘ecological theory' will lead to more-reliable predictions of the likely benefits of specific treatment regimes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Culture and molecular approaches have established that lower airway infections are polymicrobial. We consider how this new perspective in cystic fibrosis (CF) may affect treatment choices.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Standard clinical microbiology of CF infection exacerbations often fails to provide indications of microbial causes that may drive the onset of exacerbation and the anticipated bacteriologic responses to the usual parenteral antibiotics prescribed as treatment. Antimicrobial responses by nonclassical members of the CF airway microbiome may explain why most patients clinically improve. These other organisms contribute to disease either directly as pathogens missed by conventional microbiology or through synergy with conventional pathogens. With these considerations, therapy may best be guided by directed antibiotic therapy to numerically significant isolates. An example is the Streptococcus milleri group, which we now believe to represent new pathogens that profile the exacerbations of infection in the CF lung and that necessitate specific antibiotic therapy to prevent loss of lung function and reduce frequency of exacerbations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: A comprehensive understanding of airway infections offers the potential for improved disease management in CF patients. Accurate quantitative microbiology will be a prerequisite for routine intervention based on the polymicrobial perspective of CF infection exacerbations.},

@article{Holling1973,
abstract = {Each family of the desert isopod Hemilepistus reaumuri uses its faeces to build an embankment around its burrow entrance in the form of a ring with an inner radius of 5-10 cm and an outer radius of 8-15 cm. Although the embankment, like the burrow entrance, is detected only by contact with the antennae, it facilitates the return to the burrow after an excursion. When a desert isopod returns from foraging it reaches the burrow entrance itself (diameter 12 mm) only in ca. 12{\%} of the observed cases by "dead reckoning"; the embankment, however, is reached six times more frequently. After detecting this landmark an isopod needs a further 12{\%} of the pathlength of the preceding excursion to locate the burrow entrance. In contrast, it travels five times further to reach its burrow from the same distance (10 cm) if the landmark is missing. The landmark is even more important when the isopod, because of a large error in orientation, can reach its burrow only by searching. Both the characteristics of the search path of H. reaumuri and the success of it's search behaviour correspond well to the respective features of a theoretical procedure, which best solves the search problem of the desert isopods assuming that a landmark is available for orientation. The optimal search procedure was calculated by using information about the probability density that an error in orientation has a given size, and the cumulative probability that the landmark is detected if the isopod searches in it's region with a given intensity. The coupling of the systematic search strategy of H. reaumuri with landmark orientation shortens the average time needed for homing by one-third. It helps an isopod to return to it's burrow after foraging even if all the orientation mechanisms normally used for this task have broken down.},

Special concern is given to the study of irreversibility, both in systems that evolve to equilibrium and in nonequilibrium stationary states. Attention is also given to the study of models displaying phase transitions and critical phenomena both in thermodynamic equilibrium and out of equilibrium.These models include the linear Glauber model, the Glauber-Ising model, lattice models with absorbing states such as the contact process and those used in population dynamic and spreading of epidemic, probabilistic cellular automata, reaction-diffusion processes, random sequential adsorption and dynamic percolation. A stochastic approach to chemical reaction is also presented.The textbook is intended for students of physics and chemistry and for those interested in stochastic dynamics.It provides, by means of examples and problems, a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the theory and its applications.},

We show that previous attempts to prove that n species cannot coexist on fewer that n resources (the "competitive exclusion principle") all make use of the very restrictive assumption that the specific growth rates of all competing species are linear functions of resource densities. When this restriction is relaxed, it becomes possible to find situations in which n species can coexist on fewer than n resources. On the basis of this and other observations we conclude that the competitive exclusion principle should be considered to apply only to coexistence at fixed densities. ?? 1976.},
