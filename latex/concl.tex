The direction of my research has slowly shifted in the last couple of months. For now, future work on the nanoparticle corona has been tabled until futher notice. My new proposal is tabled below, where new items are bolded and dropped items are striken out.

This computational work aims to guide the design of nanoparticles that increases uptake and distribution in the tumor. 
In the immediate future, I plan to finish work on the simuations listed above before working on small models describing interactions of different species within the tumor.
We intend to  continue working closely with our experimental collaborators to facilitate the feedback on both ends.
Problems in the therapy strategies will surely be encountered however these can be further incorporated to our computational models and our hypothesis tested in a laboratory setting.
